    <h2 id="fancy_font">Summary...</h2>
    <p>WildFire is a recreational web application designed to generate buzz for any special event by     incrementally revealing its location on a map based on the amount of times a specified hashtag was   tweeted.
    </p>
    <h2><p id="fancy_font">Here is how it works...</p></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You provide us with details of your event on our <a href='/contact'> Contact Page </a>.</li>
      <li>We will show your event to a large local audience and create a custom Twitter driven event page for you.</li>
      <li>The location of your event will be shown in a series of maps, with increasing zoom and a shrinking radius as those interested in your event drive up Twitter buzz.</li>
      <li>Once your Twitter goal has been met, we will reveal the location, and any other details about your event, allowing the Twitter buzz to translate to a huge and enthusiastic audience for you event. </li>
